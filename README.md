# tombola_python
Small Python interface with Tkinter to draw prices for a tombola 

## Still in development, use it wisely

I'll try to release an official version when I'll consider it finished

## How to use it
The initialization is quite simple, you need a csv file containing the people who participate to the tombola.
Later shall be added a list of the the prices to win.

Run the gui.py script and the tool will open

Then only run the tombola and enjoy
